# Portfolio-Project

This project was designed to test all of my skills that I learned so far. By the end of this project, I should have a portfolio-ready project I share on my resume as well as with potential employers.

This project:

Has a deployed front-end application.
Allows for user interaction through button clicks and form inputs.
Makes requests to an external API.
Has a theme and unique product design.

#External APIs

I choose from a list of API and I decided to use the news generator API
https://newsapi.org/

#Description

This application is supposed to be a simplified copy of any general news application/wedsite, where headlines are displayed and different news options are available as well as a search bar for especific topics/subjects. 

If repository is forked and cloned, an HTML, CSS, and JS files could be found.
